                <p>I was born in North Kingstown, RI in 1990. I grew up in a nice quite neighborhood, a minute walk from the ocean.
                My first career was as a musician-which I loved dearly. Unfortunately there is not much money
                in music, so I had to find other sources of income. I decided to go to school for Massage Therapy
                at Bancroft, which is located in Worcester MA. That career allowed me to survive while still playing
                music at night. I eventually burned out from rubbing strangers bodies and did electrical
                work for 3 years.</P> 
               <p>I learned quite a bit from doing electrical work, but at the end of the day it was very repetitive,
                 and the people I was working with were not people I wanted to surround myself with.
                I went back to school for mechanical engineering and one day my friend convinced me 
                to take a coding class. I was hooked! I find myself thinking about coding atleast 5 hours 
                a day and I am always excited to get back on the computer to figure out the next step.
